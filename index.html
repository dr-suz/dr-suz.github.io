        <h1>Suzanne Thornton</h1>
        <p>I am currently working as a PREP Research Scientist at George Washington University. In this position, I collaborate on research with the Statistical Engineering Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Since graduating in 2019, I have worked mainly as a college educator and statistical researcher. This experience has taught me to strive to share accessible statistical information and has developed my appreciation for statistics as a language of  science that works best when it used responsibly and ethically. As a researcher, I have several technical publications involving theoretical and computational statistical developments as well as many non-technical publications on issues relevant to my discipline. I am a skilled statistical programmer and I am experienced with grant writing and managing/mentoring small groups of people from different backgrounds, with various skillsets. 
        <!---I am passionate about my service to the disciplines of statistics and data science which has provided me with many leadership opportunities. This year I am serving the American Statistical Association as Chair of the LGBTQ+ Advocacy Committee.---> </p> 
        <p></p>
        <h2>Are you hiring?</h2>
         <p>Although I have thoroughly enjoyed working at NIST, my position is a temporary one and I am on the job market! I am looking for a permanent position where I can apply my statistical training and coding expertise to solve real world problems. Bonus points for a position where I can contribute to statistical education objectives! I am excited about the opportunity to find a fulfilling, life-long career. I wish to begin my new job by August 2025 or sooner. My four pets and I are quite content at my home in Phildelphia but I will happily consider relocating with assistance.

        <!--<h2>Why is stewardship important?</h2>
        <p>This section will be longer someday but for now, let me share with you the thoughts of someone else on what they call <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01174.x">cargo-cult statistics</a>. More generally, stewardship is concerned with maintaining the integrity of a discipline (see <a href="">this artile on stewardship</a>, for example.) Many professional societies have weighed in on what it means to be an ethical (and implicitly stewardly) statistican (or statistical practitioner. Here are two of what I consider to be the most prominent guildelines.
