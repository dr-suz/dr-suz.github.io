        <h1>Suzanne Thornton</h1>
        <p>Since graduating with my PhD in 2019, I have worked mainly as an educator and published statistical researcher. This experience has taught me to strive to share accessible statistical information and to understand statistics as a language for understanding science that works best when it is used responsibly and ethically. As a researcher, I have several technical publications involving theoretical and computational statistical developments as well as many non-technical publications on issues relevant to my discipline. I am a skilled statistical programer (mainly working with R) and have self-taught myself various data science skills (e.g. SQL, Git, Tableau). I am experienced with grant writing and managing/mentoring small groups of people from different backgrounds and with various skillsets. I am passionate about my service to the disciplines of statistics and data science which has provided me with many leadership opportunities.</p> 
        <p>This year, I organized (and will be presenting in) a Joint Statistical Meetings conference session about incorporating social justice and ethical reasoning into the undergraduate statistics curriculum. I have also served the discipline through my work at the American Statistical Association as a founding member of the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Organizing Group (2021) and as the appointed leader of the LGBT+ Inclusivity and Diversity Working Group (2020). In 2022, I was nominated to serve on the National Advisory committee to the US Census. I am in the second of my three year term where I work with other dedicated volunteers to make recommendations on how Census data is obtained, stored, and applied in ways that are consistent with ethical statistical practice.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Are you hiring?<h2>
         <p>I am on the job market! I am looking for a permanent position where I can apply my statistical training and coding expertise to solve real world problems. I am excited about the opportunity to find a fulfilling, life-long career. I hope to begin my new job by the end of the calendar year. My four pets and I are quite content at my home in Phildelphia but will consider relocating with assistance. 
         </p> 
        <!--<h2>Why is stewardship important?</h2>
        <p>This section will be longer someday but for now, let me share with you the thoughts of someone else on what they call <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01174.x">cargo-cult statistics</a>. More generally, stewardship is concerned with maintaining the integrity of a discipline (see <a href="">this artile on stewardship</a>, for example.) Many professional societies have weighed in on what it means to be an ethical (and implicitly stewardly) statistican (or statistical practitioner. Here are two of what I consider to be the most prominent guildelines.
