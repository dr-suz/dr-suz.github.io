# Suzanne Thornton

Suzy (Suzanne) Thornton completed a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Florida and a Ph.D. in Statistics at Rutgers in 2019. In 2020 she chaired an ASA presidential working group on LGBTQ+ representation and inclusion in the discipline. In 2022 she was appointed to a three year term to serve on the National Advisory Committee for the US Census. She understands statistics as a language of science and her scholarship aims to promote stewardship of the discipline.

Why is stewardship necessary? For a poignant example, read [this article about "cargo-cult statistic"](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01174.x). For more examples, continue reading below!
